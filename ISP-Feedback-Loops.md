A Feedback Loop (FBL) is a system by which an Internet Service Provider provides the sender a copy of the message that one of their subscribers has reported as spam — usually by hitting a “report spam” button in that ISP’s mail interface.

ISPs offer feedback loops to qualified senders, so the senders can identify subscribers who no longer want to receive similar mail and/or any problems originating from their networks, such as virus-infected spam-producing machines.

This page summarizes the information about FBL signup pages, whitelist pages, and postmaster pages of most popular ISPs around the world.
